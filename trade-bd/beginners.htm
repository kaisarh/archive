    site all about?</b></font><br />
    Have you ever been tired looking for an 'old hard disk' 
    or a '2nd hand laptop'? Most of us will say &quot;of course&quot;, and some of us will add &quot;I'm 
    still looking for a blah blah...&quot;. Well the hard days are over. In this age 
    of the Internet, you should get everything with a few mouse click. But what 
    about old items? Yes this is what the Internet gives you too. Now you can find 
    any old items or can sell any of yours in this web site.<font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    </font>
    <br>
    In a word, this is the web site where you can sell your old 
    and unnecessary items and buy others' items that you need. You can sell almost anything here (illegal and explicit items are 
    <b>not</b> included in 'anything' of course).<br>
    <br>
    This web site works in a very simple manner, it actually 
    makes the contact between the seller and the buyer. When the seller and the 
    buyer get each other's full contacting information from this web site, they 
    can simply make the trade by a head to head meeting. [To clarify more, just 
    in case any kid is reading this material, the buyer and seller can meet in 
    some place where they can exchange/trade]. The purpose of this web site is 
    simply for making the contact between the seller and the buyer.<br>
    <br>
    One of the main features of this web site is that it is 
    specialized for Bangladeshies. And most of all, this web site gives all of 
    its services for <b>FREE</b>!</p>

    <img border="0" src="images/qus.gif" width="41" height="48"><b>What exactly can 
    I sell here?</b><br />
    </font>You can sell almost anything. For example: Your PC, Laptop, any PC 
    Accessories (Hard Disk, Mother Board, Printer etc), any Electronic Product 
    (TV, Freezer, Washing Machine, Air Cooler, Sound System, DVD/VCD player, 
    Camera, Camcorder, Mobile Set, Walkman, Discman etc), your vehicles (Bike, 
    Motor Bike, Car, Bus etc). You can also sell your old Books and CDs (Audio, 
    Video, MP3, Software, Game). In a word you can sell here almost anything you 
    like.</p>

      <img border="0" src="images/qus.gif" width="41" height="48"><b>How does the 
      selling/buying take place here?</b><br />
      </font>First of all the seller signs up with his full name and contacting 
      address. Then he/she adds his/her items into our Item List. The buyer (who also 
      has signed up with full name and contacting address) can view every 
      seller's items in the list. When the buyer chooses and decides to buy an 
      item the contacting information of the seller is sent to the buyer. On the 
      same time the seller also receives a notification about his/her item. The 
      seller can then also view the buyer's contacting information. This is the 
      part that the sellers and buyers do in this site. After that they can 
      contact with each other to meet somewhere and exchange/trade the items. 
      This is how simple it is.<br>
      <br>
      All signed up users can be both seller and buyer at a time. 
      Every general user can add at most 12 items to the list and can reserve 2 
      items at a time. When the items are sold, the user can add/reserve more. 
      Any user can cancel any sell or any reservation at any time. Please read 
      the Rules &amp; Regulations to know more.</p>
