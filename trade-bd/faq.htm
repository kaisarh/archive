    number of items a general user can reserve at a time. The items you have 
    reserved to needs to be confirmed by the seller or you need to cancel an 
    item in order to reserve another item. But remember, according to the
    <a href="rules.htm">Rules</a> if you cancel any reservation more than 3 
    times in a year, your membership will be cancelled and banned.</p>
