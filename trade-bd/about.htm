        <br>
    Thank you for your kind 
    interest about me. I'm the only developer of this web site. The history 
    behind developing this web site is basically my and my friends' needs. I had 
    been feeling for  a web site like this one for a long time 
    (almost 2 years). But unfortunately there was no web site made specially for Bangladeshies for 
    trading old/new things. So I really wanted to 
    build this site. I am basically a VB and VC programmer so I couldn't really 
    start this site that time (two years back). But when I learned ASP, I 
    immediately started to work with this site. You can say this is my first ASP 
    project.<br>
    <br>
    I worked almost 200 hours for the development of this site. I used Active Server Pages (using 
    VBScript) as the front end language and  SQL as the back end. I used Photoshop 
    for graphics.<br>
    <br>
    I would like to thank one guy for 
    helping me out with various ideas about this site and he is my pal 
    'Johnnie'. He also helped me out by checking the bugs. I call him My 
    Official Bug Checker..;-)<br>
    <br>
    Finally, I would like to say that my 
    hard work will be successful if you find this web site useful for you. If 
    you do then please add some comments to the Guest Book.<br>
    <br>
    Thank you,<br>
    Kaisar<br>
